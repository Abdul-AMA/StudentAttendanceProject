# StudentAttendanceProject
This project is very good
you may need to get some libraries
the program GUI I very simple and easy

the login interface has a username and password where you can use yours
you have forget password option if you did (try not to cuz its useless)
you also have lost data option that you can use if your data have been lost or corrupted (you may lose your last modification)
you have 2 options Admin or Teacher

for admin, it's just one account with admin as username and password
in the admin interface you can create edit show courses and create edit show teachers 
you can also link the teacher with his course
notes:
1)the teacher has only one course
2) the edit can be done from tables by double click on the field and change the value

for teacher, you can use your username and password that was created by the admin
you can create and add students to the course and edit their data and even remove them 
you can show students in the course and show student statistics
